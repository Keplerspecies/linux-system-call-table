POSIX does not specify any<br>       error conditions.<br></pre><br><h2>NOTES  </h2><pre><br>       POSIX.1 defines <i>seconds since the Epoch</i> using a formula that<br>       approximates the number of seconds between a specified time and the<br>       Epoch.  This formula takes account of the facts that all years that<br>       are evenly divisible by 4 are leap years, but years that are evenly<br>       divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they are also evenly<br>       divisible by 400, in which case they are leap years.  This value is<br>       not the same as the actual number of seconds between the time and the<br>       Epoch, because of leap seconds and because system clocks are not<br>       required to be synchronized to a standard reference.  The intention<br>       is that the interpretation of seconds since the Epoch values be<br>       consistent; see POSIX.1-2008 Rationale A.4.15 for further rationale.<br></pre><br><h2>SEE ALSO  </h2><pre><br>       date(1), gettimeofday(2), ctime(3), ftime(3), time(7)<br></pre><br><h2>COLOPHON  </h2><pre><br>       This page is part of release 4.02 of the Linux <i>man-pages</i> project.
